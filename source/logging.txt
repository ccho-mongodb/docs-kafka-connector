In this guide, you can learn how to configure the logging settings for your
{+mkc+} and how to access the log messageid. Log messages can help you debug
issues that you may encounter with your connector or data pipeline by
surfacing events and exceptions.

Access the Logs
---------------

When using {+kafka-connect+} Docker image, you can view the most
recent log messages reported by all the services running on it.

First, identify the container ID

.. code-block:: bash

   docker container ls

   CONTAINER ID  IMAGE
   538ad46ae0f9  confluentinc/cp-kafka-connect-base:<version>

Next, tail the log file using the following command from your shell:

.. code-block:: bash

   docker logs -f <container id>

For other methods of accessing the logs, see the Confluent documentation on
`Viewing Connect Logs <https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/connect/logging.html#viewing-kconnect-logs>`__

To configure your {+mkc+}, first locate your configuration directory.
This is often ``/etc/kafka``

Update or add the following setting in your ``connect-log4j.properties`` file

.. code-block: properties

   connect.log.pattern=[%d] %p %X{connector.context}%m (%c:%L)%n

To toggle logging for errors see: TODO
